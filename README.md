Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.57.0

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "eslint-plugin-react-compiler".

(The package "eslint-plugin-react-compiler" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "/Users/julius/Downloads/react-compiler-eslint-loading-error".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install eslint-plugin-react-compiler@latest --save-dev

The plugin "eslint-plugin-react-compiler" was referenced from the config file in ".eslintrc.cjs".
```
